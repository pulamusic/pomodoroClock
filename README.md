# pomodoro clock

This is a [freeCodeCamp front-end development project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock). I've nearly broken my brain on this one, for some reason - the code is a mess. In any event, it should turn out to be a useful little app.
